# MapReset
A 1.20.1 plugin that lets you reset your map to the map you want
(useful for minigames where you just want to reset new built/destroyed blocks and this lets you do it). 
You upload your map into the mapreset/maps folder and execute the /mapreset command to reset your map to the map you uploaded.
