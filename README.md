# MapReset
This is a 1.20.1 MapReset Plugin, which lets you upload your own map.
Then you are able to execute the /mapreset command to reset your world to the map you've uploaded.
This might be useful for Minigames, where the base of the map should be kept the same, but modifications by the players, like placed or removed blocks shouldn't be kept.

Here you can directly download the plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mapreset.111103/
